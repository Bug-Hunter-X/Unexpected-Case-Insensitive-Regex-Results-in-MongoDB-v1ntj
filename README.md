# Unexpected Case-Insensitive Regex Results in MongoDB

This example demonstrates a potential issue when using case-insensitive regular expressions in MongoDB queries. The issue arises when you have different types in your collection for a given field and only one is matched, potentially leaving you with an incomplete result set.

## Bug Description

The following code snippet uses a case-insensitive regular expression to search for documents containing the name 'John' in a MongoDB collection. However, the issue is subtle but significant. Let's say some entries in your collection have `name` as string and others as `ObjectId`. If the case-insensitive regex search matches only strings, then the `ObjectId` entries will not show up in the results. This will lead to an incomplete data set which might not be obvious until the application requires a complete data set. 

## Bug Solution

To rectify this issue, ensure that before querying your collection, you validate that all `name` field entries match your query's expectations and are of a single, suitable type. For example, if you use a string case-insensitive regex, you might need to validate and convert any ObjectId to a string before querying.
